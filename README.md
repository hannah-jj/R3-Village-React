Description

To teach kids about Reduce, Reuse & Recycle (R3) through games and learnings. R3 Village is a virtual village where each villager have the options of getting new toy, replaying with old toy, recycling toy, trashing toy or learning thrugh a game without any toy. Each action increases the pollution of the village and/or the happiness level of the villager. Once the pollution level of the village reaches a certain level, background will go to total black.

No one can truly wins the game because pollution level increases anytime anyone get a new toy. Villagers can only survive in the long term if everyone takes part in R3 - Reduce, Reuse & Recycle. Rich or poor, when the home is destroyed, everyone is doomed.
